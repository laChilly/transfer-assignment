"Commit to Success"

Sebastian was a master of working solo. 
For years, he had been programming small tools and scripts that only he used, 
and his approach was as chaotic as his desk: empty pizza boxes everywhere, 
sticky notes with cryptic code snippets, and a crumpled manual 
for a programming language he had long forgotten.
