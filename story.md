"Commit to Success"

Sebastian was a master of working solo. 
For years, he had been programming small tools and scripts that only he used, 
and his approach was as chaotic as his desk: empty pizza boxes everywhere, 
sticky notes with cryptic code snippets, and a crumpled manual 
for a programming language he had long forgotten.
But this time was different. His buddy Jan had invited him to 
join a project that sounded too exciting to pass up: 
a tool to manage football databases, making it easy for amateur players and 
hobby analysts to organize tables, player stats, and match analyses. 
It was a dream project – until the team hit reality.

From the start, conflicts arose. Jan wasn’t the only other 
developer in the team. There was also David, 
an obsessive code perfectionist who got on Sebastian’s nerves within the first week. 
While Sebastian focused on functionality, David ruthlessly corrected formatting, 
renamed variables, and – to Sebastian’s utter frustration – 
occasionally deleted entire chunks of code, claiming they were “useless.”

“I spent two days working on the player profile feature!” 
Sebastian ran his hands through his hair, staring at the screen. 
“Where did my changes go?” David shrugged in the group chat, 
replying casually, “Didn’t make sense. I replaced them with something better.”
Sebastian felt his blood pressure rise.
